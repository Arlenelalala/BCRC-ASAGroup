### Papers

#### 1. CrowdPose: Efficient Crowded Scenes Pose Estimation and A New Benchmark

* **Info:**

  --2019CVPR

  --Jiefeng Li, Cewu Lu

- **Related work:**

  To address the crowd problem in MPPE(Multi-persons pose estimation).

- **Proposed method:**

  Three contributions:

  * The author proposed joints candidate loss  in SPPE, which takes the inference joints into consideration.
  * The author developed a new globally optimizing association algorithm to replace the historical NMS algorithms, achieving better performance with the same complexity. This method draws on the person-joint graph.
  * To better evaluate the proposed method, the author established CrowdPose dataset which follows unified distribution at crowd index. *Crowd index* is a standard to evaluate the crowding level, defined by the author.

- **My views:**

  - awesome. I like this boy.(The author) And I have watched his presentation, he is handsome.
  - The dataset has been released. Maybe there is something I can do with it.
