#### 1. CrowdPose: Efficient Crowded Scenes Pose Estimation and A New Benchmark

- **Related work:**

  Current pose estimation networks, no matter top-down or bottom-up, both are two-stage based, greatly reducing the efficiency. They tend to represent the human keypoints by isolated cordinates, which breaks down the nature association of human body. Through there have been a lot of methods to assemble the joints of a certain identity, such as PCA in openpose,  embedding vector combining with a greedy algorithm, association scores.

- **Proposed method:**

  The author proposes a new method to represent the location and the keypoints in a unified way and regress them in dingle-stage, truly achieving end-to-end training and testing. The result is not so stunning but the method is innovative enough to inspire more inventions. What's more, the introduction of *Hierarchical SPR* can effectively solve the long-distance offset problem.

  The unified way is that the author introduce the person centroid as the root joint of a person instance and keypoints as offset vectors, namely structured pose representation (*SPR*). During training , the network produces a root joint heatmap and K joints heatmaps for every picture. In the case of large scale action, we can replace the *SPR* with *Hierarchical SPR*.

- **My views:**

  - In Hierarchical SPR, the author divides the joints into four stage, and the position of joints in fourth stage is accumulated stage by stage, during which the error will transfer and accumulate gradually, harming the accuracy of final results. (Guessing)
  - The calculation method of centroid by keypoints location labels is not introduced clearly, making me confused and unhappy.
