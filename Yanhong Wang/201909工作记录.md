### Papers

#### 1. Simple Baselines for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking (SimpleBaseline)

* **Related work:**

  * **Pose Estimation Using A Deconvolution Head Network**

  * **Pose Tracking Based on Optical Flow**

    The winner of ICCV'17 PoseTrack Challenge first uses Mask R-CNN to estimate human pose, then performs online tracking with a greedy bipartite matching algorithm frame by frame.

* **Proposed method:**

  * **Pose Estimation Using A Deconvolution Head Network**

    The popular SPPEs perform pose estimation by high-to-low and low-to-high processes. This work differs from the typical Hourglass and CPN in low-to-high process with combining the upsampling and convolutional parameters into deconvolutional layers.

  * **Pose Tracking Based on Optical Flow**

    Following the pipeline of ICCV'17 PoseTrack Challenge winner, this work adds a human detector generated from previous frames using optical flow and utilizes a flow-based pose similarity metric in greedy matching algorithm.

    When the processing frame is difficult for human detectors, the flow-based human detector works.

* **My views:**

#### 2. Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation (HRnet)

* **Related works:**

  This is the state-of-the-art work for multiple person pose estimation (MPPE), based on SimpleBaseline, achieving 0.770 mAP on the COCO2017 test-dev set.

  The two typical methods of MPPE is top-down and bottom-up. The former have achieves better mAP of 0.770 while the latter is 70.5. **This work belongs to the former**, which mainly consists of a human detector and single person pose estimation (SPPE).

  **This work focus on the the design of SPPE**. The popular design of SPPE is divided into two steps: high-to-low process aiming to generate low-resolution and high-level representations,  and low-to-high process aiming to produce high-resolution representations. Hourglass and its extensions combine low-level features in the high-to-low process progressively through skip connections.

* **Proposed method:**

  **This method builds parallel multi-resolution subnetworks** rather than sequential multi-resolution subnetworks in existing works.

  **This work introduce repeated multi-scale fusion across parallel subnetworks.** By using *exchange units*, the features can be generated from various informations.

  <font color='red'>Haven't fully understand</font>:no_mouth:

* **My views:**

  * Strengths:
    * Compared to other works, this method keep high resolution representations in the whole process, which i think can maintain the low-level features, thus achieving better results.
    * It looks like the work adds a lot of operations in the processing but in fact the parameters and GFLOPs slightly decrease. I think it is because that during upsampling, they adopt the simple nearest neighbor sampling following a 1x1 convolution rather than deconvolution which needs two convolutional operations. 
  * Shortcuts:
    * In writing, this paper hasn't clearly illustrated the process of exchange units. :joy::joy::joy:

#### 3. Bottom-up Higher-Resolution Networks for Multi-Person Pose Estimation (HigherHRNet )

* **Related work:**

  * As illustrated above, pose estimation work are divided into two fields, and the former two belong to  top-down while this belongs to bottom-up. But what's funny is that the most related work are the former two. 
  * **The current state of pose estimation is that the top-down method has achieve <font color='red'>0.770</font> mAP,  much better than bottom-up's <font color='red'>0.687</font>.** The bottom-up method first extracted heatmaps for every key points and then assembling the key points to identities, during which the author believes the accuracy of predict heatmaps is the bottleneck. By introducing another extracted algorithm, **this work has achieved state-of-the-art result of <font color='red'>0.705</font> mAP among bottom-up field. **

* **Proposed method:**

  Inspired by HRnet and SimpleBaseline, the author utilizes the architecture in HRnet to maintain high resolution feature maps to predict heatmaps rather than the traditional ones recovering  from low resolution maps. They propose a multi-resolution supervision in training stage and a heatmap aggregation strategy for inference to let HigherHRNet predict scale-aware heatmaps.

* **My views**:

  * This work has not much innovations but introducing some new structures in state-of-the-art method in top-down into up-bottom. But it works.:joy:

  * The assembling methods develops as below: 1, PCA is proposed in openpose which learns a 2D vector field linking two keypoints, grouping pairs with the most line integral. 2, Associate embedding assigns each keypoint with a 'tag' (a vector representation) and groups keypoints based on the l2 distance between tag vectors. 3, PersonLab uses dilated ResNet and groups keypoints by directly learning a 2D offset field for each pair of keypoints.

    From the process we can see, the grouping method tends to use more rich representation and tends to learn automatically without the prior knowledge, during which we can possibly do something.

### Papers

#### 1. Single-Stage Multi-Person Pose Machines (SPM)

* **Related work:**

  Current pose estimation networks, no matter top-down or bottom-up, both are two-stage based, greatly reducing the efficiency. They tend to represent the human keypoints by isolated cordinates, which breaks down the nature association of human body. Through there have been a lot of methods to assemble the joints of a certain identity, such as PCA in openpose,  embedding vector combining with a greedy algorithm, association scores.

* **Proposed method:**

  The author proposes a new method to represent the location and the keypoints in a unified way and regress them in dingle-stage, truly achieving end-to-end training and testing. The result is not so stunning but the method is innovative enough to inspire more inventions. What's more, the introduction of *Hierarchical SPR* can effectively solve the long-distance offset problem.

  The unified way is that the author introduce the person centroid as the root joint of a person instance and keypoints as offset vectors, namely structured pose representation (*SPR*). During training , the network produces a root joint heatmap and K joints heatmaps for every picture. In the case of large scale action, we can replace the *SPR* with *Hierarchical SPR*.

* **My views:**

  * In Hierarchical SPR, the author divides the joints into four stage, and the position of joints in fourth stage is accumulated stage by stage, during which the error will transfer and accumulate gradually, harming the accuracy of final results. (Guessing)
  * The calculation method of centroid by keypoints location labels is not introduced clearly, making me confused and unhappy.
