### 数据标注
* 根据2019年8月1日至8月7日的微博，抖音，头条的热搜，根据原有的754个标签，扩展到1753个标签，共261个事件，每个标签至多30条原创微博，其中单标签微博16888条，多标签微博13131条，根据微博发布时间和事件产生顺序，产生29758个正例，30017个负例，共59775对数据，去除多标签文本中的异常值，完成标注
* 以最简单的无监督的方法做实验，认为出现在一起的标签即为同一事件，有一个基本的评估
* 计划继续用一些无监督的方法以及有监督的方法进行实验
* 继续调研，借鉴别人的方法

## [Event Detection in Social Streams](http://charuaggarwal.net/sdm2012-camera.pdf)
### Introduction
* study the two related problems of clustering and event detection in social streams
* study both the supervised and unsupervised case for the event detection problem
* illustrate the effectiveness of incorporating network structure in event discovery over purely content-based methods
* it is often necessary to process the data in a ``single pass`` and one cannot store all the data on disk for re-processing
* ``study the problems`` of clustering and event detection in social streams in which each text message is associated with at least a pair of actors in the ``social network``
* both network locality and structure need to be leveraged in a dynamic streaming scenario for the event detection process
### key challenges for event detection
* The ability to use ``both the content and the (graphical) structure`` of the interactions for event detection.
* The ability to use ``temporal information`` in the event detection process
* The ability to handle very ``large and massive`` volumes of text documents under the one-pass constraint of streaming scenarios
### The Model
* the object Si is represented by the tuple (``qi``(tweeting actor),``Ri``(recipient set), ``Ti``(twitter content))
* ``NOVEL EVENT:`` The arrival of a data point Si is said to be a novel event if it is placed as a single point within a newly created cluster Ci. ``An evolution event`` is defined with respect to specific time horizon and represents a change in the relative activity for that particular cluster. ``fractional presence`` is denoted by F(t1, t2, Ci)
* use ``sketch-based methods`` in order to compute the similarities more effectively
* ``cluster-summary`` ψi(Ci) = (Vi, ηi,Wi,Φi)
* In each iteration, we compute the similarity of the incoming social stream object Si to ``each cluster summary ψi(Ci)``.we maintain the mean μ and standard deviation σ of all closest similarity values of incoming stream objects to cluster summaries. The similarity value is said to be significantly below the threshold, if it is less than ``μ−3·σ``. If a new cluster is created ,the cluster ``replaces`` the most stale cluster from the current collection C1 . . . Ck.
* In order to compute the similarity, we need to compute both the structural ``SimS(Si, Cr))`` and the content components ``SimC(Si, Cr)`` (TF-IDF)of the similarity value
### Event Detection with Clustering
* it is always assigned to its closest cluster
* The assumption in the supervised case is that the training data about the social stream objects which are related to the event are available in the historical training data
### Experimental Results
* dataset
    * Twitter Social Stream: 1,628,779 tweets, 59,192,401 nodes, 
    * Enron Email Stream: a total of 349911 emails, a total of 29,083 individuals
* Evaluation Measures
    * For the case of the Twitter stream, these class labels were the ``hash tags`` which were associated with the tweet. the hash tags were only associated with a subset of the tweets. 
    * For the case of the Enron email stream, the class labels were defined by the ``most frequently occurring tokens`` in the subject line.
    * For the case of the unsupervised algorithm, we will present ``a case study``
* network information in the social stream provides much more powerful information for clustering as compared to the text-information

### 思考
* 只是以简单的TD-IDF计算相似度
* 没有利用时间特征
* 以时间窗口的方法体现的事件的变化
* 使用标准正太分布来挑选阈值
* 社交网络相似度的计算没太看懂
* 以hashtag作为ground truth并不合理，如果能直接识别出hashtag，聚类将没有意义，对于多标签的处理也不明确

## [Identifying Content for Planned Events Across Social Media Sites](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2130000/2124360/p533-becker.pdf?ip=202.120.224.53&id=2124360&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=BF85BBA5741FDC6E%2E88014DC677A1F2C3%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1570539867_62c67a2fe4e6077fb3bc6f0e28ed3534)
### INTRODUCTION
* explore approaches for identifying diverse social media content for planned events
* Automatically identifying social media content associated with known events is a challenging problem due to the heterogenous and noisy nature of the data.
* propose a ``two-step`` query generation approach: 
    * the first step combines known event features into several queries aimed at retrieving high-precision results; 
    * the second step uses these high-precision results along with text processing techniques such as term extraction and frequency analysis to build additional queries, aimed at improving recall

### RELATEDWORK
* quality content extraction in social media
* event identification in textual news
* event identification in social media

### MOTIVATION AND APPROACH
* define an event as a real-world occurrence e with 
    * an associated time period Te and 
    * a time-ordered stream of social media documents De discussing the occurrence and published during time Te
* ![](https://github.com/qiuxingfa/picture_/blob/master/2019/18153cc6ad50eccf1d31b9374960bd1.png)
* In a study of trends on Twitter, Kwak et al.discovered that most trends last for one week once they become "active"
* We consider two important criteria for ordering the event queries: ``specificity``(rank long, detailed queries) and ``temporal profile``
* we can leverage event content from one social media site to help retrieve event documents from another social media site in different ways

### EXPERIMENTS
* Comparison of the automatically generated queries against human-produced queries for the events
* Evaluation by human judges of the automatically generated queries
* Evaluation of the quality of the documents retrieved by the automatically generated queries
* Planned Event ``Dataset``: We assembled a dataset of event records posted between May 13, 2011 and June 11, 2011 on four dierent event aggregation platforms
* comparison against human-produced queries, human evaluation of generated queries, and evaluation of document retrieval results. use the ``Jaccard coeficient`` to measure the similarity of the set of automatically generated queries G to the set of human-produced queries H for each event.
* asked two annotators to label 2,037 queries selected by our strategies for each event on a scale of 1-5, based on their relevance to the event.

### 思考
* 类似于从事件文本中提取代表文本、代表的关键词，提取有效信息，在选取事件表示时值得借鉴
* 事件是有时效性的
* 结合了基于准确率和基于召回率的方法，即考虑不同粒度
* 文章还使用了不同来源的文本，相互促进
