**1. Framework:**

2D image --> Encoder_id --> 199-dim representation --> Decoder_id (159,642 dim)  -->  +  -->  3D point clouds

â€‹			   --> Encoder_expr --> 29-dim representation --> Decoder_expr (159,642 dim) ---^



Constraints: MSE loss, SoftMax loss, Contrastive loss.

End-to-end training.

**2. Problems:**

3D point clouds do not converge well. S = m + w * a

Numerical range (x, y, z):  

* BFM Shape vertices:  e+5

* BFM Expression vertices: e+3
* Adjusting the numerical value to facilitate learning.

Debugging.

**3. Multi-Task Learning:**

1. 3D reconstruction (NoW)
2. Face recognition (LFW, CK+)
3. Facial expression recognition (CK+, RAF-DB)
