**About  Hamming**

**Richard Wesley Hamming** (1915 - 1998) was an American mathematician whose work had many implications for computer engineering and telecommunications.

* Manhattan Project, Los Alamos Laboratory, 1945

* Bell Telephone Laboratories, 1946-1976

* Turing Award, Association for Computing Machinery, 1968

* Motto:

* > The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.

**Abstract**

This talk centered on Hamming's contributions and research on the question "**Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?**", covering what he has learned in terms of the properties of the individual scientists, their abilities, traits, working habits, attitudes, and philosophy.

**Simple Rules for Doing Your Best Research**

1. **Drop modesty **

   I would like to do first-class work or do something significant. 

   Self-motivated.

2. **Prepare your mind**

   Pasteur said, "Luck favors the prepared mind."

   Newton said, "If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results."

3. **Don't worry about age**

   Continue to exposure yourself to new and challenging ideas.

   Become involved in entirely new fields from time to time, which tends to promote creative thinking outside established dogma.

4. **Brains are not enough, you also need courage**

   People may reject papers, expressing vehement opposition to a new idea. For really groundbreaking ideas, there may even be hecklers at talks!

   The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it.

5. **Make the best of your working conditions**

   One of the better times of the Cambridge Physical Laboratories was when they had practically shacks - they did some of the best physics ever.

6. **Work hard and effectively**

   Edison said, "Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration." 

   Just hard work is not enough - it must be applied sensibly.

7. **Believe and doubt your hypothesis at the same time**

   Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well.

   They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. 

   It requires a lovely balance.

8. **Work on the important problem in your field**

   "What are the important problems of your field?"

   "What important problems are you working on?"

   If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work.

9. **Be committed to your problem**

   Creativity comes out of your subconscious.

   When you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - keep your thoughts on the problem. 

   Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.

10. **Leave your door open**

    If you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most.

    He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally get clues as to what the world is and what might be important.
