## Course reading materials

1. *On Reading Academic Literature (Strategically)* by Dr. Anthony Bernier, 6 pages

2. *How to Read a Paper* by S. Keshav, 3 pages, School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo

Both of those two articles are interesting and stimulating, contributing directly to my academic and scholarly material reading greatly, which deserve recommendation consequently.

Key points:

1. Central Question
2. Answer (thesis)
3. Reading Backwards (the concluding section and the introduction)
4. the Three-Pass Approach
   1. a general idea
      1. carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
      2. read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
      3. read the conclusions
      4. glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read
   2. paper's content
      1. ignore details such as proofs
      2. jot down the key points
      3. make comments in the margin
      4. common mistakes will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent
   3. in-depth understanding
      1. attempt to virtually re-implement the paper
      2. reconstruct the entire identity of the paper from memory.
      3. identify its strong and weak points
