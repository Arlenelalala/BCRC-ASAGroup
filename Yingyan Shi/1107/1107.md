# Machine Learning Workshop

## Support Vector Machines

**Prologue:**  Ideas in Machine Learning have a "winner takes all" quality. When an idea takes off, it dominates the field so completely that one tends to believe it is the only idea worth pursuing. Today, Deep Learning is cool. A few years back learning algorithms like Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were just as cool. These traditional methods have some benefits over Deep Learning in certain application domains. They sometimes need less data to train on and it takes minutes (instead of hours or days) to train. Fast training time means you can perform more experiments and bring a product to market faster. A good machine learning engineer is not married to a specific technique. They learn a bag of tools and apply the right tool for the right problem. (Source: https://www.learnopencv.com/support-vector-machines-svm/)

**Epilogue:** It is quite troublesome for its math derivation from intuition to a tractable solution, but a off-the-shelf model.
